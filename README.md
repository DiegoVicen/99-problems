# 99 Python Problems

99 problems is just a collection of problems extracted from the book the [Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland. This repository aims to solve the problems proposed in the book in the most clean way possible, trying to achieve a readable code while understanding the solution of the problem.

Currently, the problems are being solved in Python.
